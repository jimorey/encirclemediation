# Encircle Mediation

## Description

This project was for a simple (mostly) static website I made for a client early 2017. Unfortunately the client received a job offer near the end of the project and decided they'd rather have that job instead of starting their own business, so the website was never used commercially.

It can be viewed here though: https://encirle-mediation.herokuapp.com/

Let it be known all potential identifying information (names, addresses, emails, phone numbers etc.) relating to the client and their business has been removed from the live development version of this website and replaced by dummy data. 

**Note:** The site may take a few seconds to load upon the initial visit as Heroku servers are designed to sleep after a short period of time. This means if no one has accessed the site for a while the server will take a bit of time to wake-up and respond to the request.
